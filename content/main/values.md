We love building great events. And there are 2 core values that we want to cultivate at all events that we participate in. We want to build **safe** and **sustainable** events.

As with everything we do we decide together with the organizers what we will do exactly, but we will make sure that these core values are visible in the event.

## Diversity and Accessibility

We care deeply about making our events a safe and welcoming space for everyone.

As with everything, this involves making many trade-offs. We want to get better at prioritising the efforts that have the most impact on safety, comfort, diversity, and accessibility. Below are ways in how we can make your events a safe place for everyone.

### What we can offer

We want to stress that the list below is not a default checklist for building a safe place. Building a safe place is something that each event needs to think about carefully. We can help you with that and with the things we offer here we can support you into building that safe place.

#### Code of Conduct (CoC)

We ask all participants, speakers, and staff, to adhere to a Code of Conduct, and mention it in the opening speech of the conference. Our goal is to create a safe and welcoming environment for all participants. We fully intend to enforce it, and have scenarios in place for dealing with violations.
We can use your CoC or we can provide you with a template for a possible CoC that you can find here TODO.

#### Contact person

A contact person must be available for reporting Code of Conduct violations and concerns.

#### Professional staff

We hire a lot of staff through suppliers (catering, hospitality, security, ...). We discuss our various accessibility and diversity requirements with these suppliers, but it is hard for us to make sure every one of the staff they bring in is fully trained. We're considering what and how to teach them about these efforts. 

#### Security

We can offer professional security staff at the venue. 

#### And more

The following list of items are both tips that can be done, as things that we can offer for you.

##### Language

We encourage you to pick one common language, and encourge participants in speaking that language. This makes it easier for others to join in conversations.

##### Gender-inclusive language

We attempt to use gender-neutral language in all our communication. Let us know when we make mistakes. We encourage you to do as well.

##### Presentation support

We can offer support to speakers who are new to public speaking, or who are developing new content. For example, we sometimes pair up new speakers with experienced speakers to give feedback on the material, or help find opportunities for new speaker to do a tryout at a meetup. 

##### Quiet Room

Having a quiet room where attendees can retreat to

##### Audio loops

We can provide audio loops if requested

## Sustainability

Organising a climate neutral event is hard, if not impossible (depending on defintions of climate neutral).  However, we can choose to lower our impact on the environment as much as possible. Inspired by the 8 R’s (Recycle - Refuse - Reduce - Reuse - Repair - Regift - Recover - Rethink), this is what we offer:

### Organisation

We plan our venue visits and meetings as much as possible by train.
Where possible we book trains instead of flights for our international speakers.
We’re looking into the options of offsetting the booked flights.
We advise our participants to come by train if possible. Amsterdam has good train connections to Brussels, London, Paris,...

### Venue

We look for venues that are easily reachable by public transport (which is also important because of accessibility).
We provide shuttle busses between the hotel and the venue. For those who are up to it, we provide the option to rent bikes at our cost at the hotel, to take the 15min bike route to the venue.
Our conference venue, the Meervaart, is working hard on being sustainable themselves by working on CO2-reduction (More info about their efforts here).
Our speakers hotel, the West Cord Fashion Hotel, focuses on sustainability and has a Green Key Label (More info here).

### Catering

We offer a minimum of 50% vegetarian food (and vegan is available upon request). We try to provide a very balanced buffet, but we prefer chicken over meat and we refrain from food like tuna etc.
We closely estimate our food amount through a careful headcount to minimise waste. We create awareness with our attendees to not throw away food. We are looking into the options of donating leftover food.
Drinks are offered in porcelain and glassware. We provide water bottles with tap water.
We provide bio straws (we can offer plastic straws for those who need it for accessibility reasons).

We discussed thoroughly with our caterer the use of reusable plates. However, for this year, we are not able to provide all of our food on reusable plates. Where needed, we will use 100% biodegradable disposables that compost within 90 days and therefore meet the EN13432 standard. Of course, the sustainable use of disposables depends on a good collection and recycling.

### Recycling

During the conference we optimize waste processing and recycling.
We will have separate trash cans with bio compostable garbage bags, for all compostables. We also have separate paperbins.

Marketing and communication

We strive to communicate as much as possible online. The internet has a large footprint and it is growing rapidly. Our website is cleaner than 58% of websites tested, but we’re working on getting a better number.

### Logistics

We use a lot of materials but we try to reuse where possible (for example lanyards, staff shirts,...).
Where possible, we order recycled paper (for post its, flyers,...).
We are looking into the options of recycling our banners.
Our totebags are fair trade and made of recycled bio cotton.
Our T-shirts are 100% bio cotton.
Our totebags and Tshirts are produced by StanleyStella, who believe that fair trade and sustainable development are natural. (More info here)
For the prints on the Tshirts and totebags we work with Groenewas, who print sustainable without chemical ink. (More info here)

We are aware that these are only small steps. We try to be more aware and adapt where we can. But if you have any tips for us, please get in touch!
